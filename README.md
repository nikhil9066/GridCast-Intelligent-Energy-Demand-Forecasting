```

#### Option 3: Production API
```bash
# Start production API (runs in demo mode until models trained)
python api/app.py
# Visit: http://localhost:5001
```

### Quick API Demo

1. **Start the API server**
   ```bash
   python api/app.py  # Now uses port 5001 (macOS compatible)
   ```

2. **Make a forecast request**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:5001/forecast" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"hours_ahead": 48}'
   ```

3. **View the dashboard**
   ```
   Open http://localhost:5001 in your browser
   ```

### Known Issues & Fixes ✅

- **Port 5000 Conflict**: Fixed - now uses port 5001 to avoid macOS AirPlay
